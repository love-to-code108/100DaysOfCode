There is an array of n Integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m Integers. You like all the Integers In set A and dislike all the Integers in set B. Your Initial
happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if i € A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i € B, you add —1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final
happiness at the end.

Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.

Constraints

1<n<10°

1<m<10°

1 < Any integer in the input < 10°

Input Format

The first line contains Integers n and m, separated by a space.
The second line contains n Integers, the elements of the array.

The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively.
Output Format
Output a single integer, your total happiness.

Sample Input
3 2
153
31
57

Sample Output
1

Explanation
You gain 1 unit of happiness for elements 3 and 1 In set A. You lose 1 unit for 5 in set B. The element 7 in set B does not exist in the array so It Is not Included In the calculation.

Hence, the total happiness is 2 — 1 = 1.
